      <h2>Facelift</h2>
      <p>I joined <a href="http://www.juiceinteractive.com" target="_blank">Juice Interactive</a> in the summer of 2013&mdash;We’re a small, talented team located in the West Loop of Chicago. Our website was in need of a facelift, and I was thrilled to be a part by being responsible for its development.</p>

      <h2>Making an honest impression</h2>
      <p>We didn’t just want to showcase our work&mdash;we wanted to take people through the process. We carefully crafted our words and hand-picked case studies to accurately represent and clearly communicate who we are, what we’re capable of, and what to expect when working with and cultivating a relationship with us.</p>

      <p>It was important to us that the content was accessible across a variety of devices and screen sizes, so it was designed and built with responsive design in mind. Built with a mobile-first approach, the website scales beautifully regardless of screen size.</p>
